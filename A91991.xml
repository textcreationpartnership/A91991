            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE grand Committee of the Eſtates of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> met (and ſate downe) on <hi>Tueſday</hi> Feb. 15. 1647 And the Lord <hi>Chancellor Loudonne</hi> (with the reſt of the Commiſſioners) went on in making their reports to them, declaring what they offered to the King, what anſwer they had from him at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court,</hi> and what Papers they had dilivered into the Parliament of <hi>England:</hi> Something concerning the City of <hi>London;</hi> and ſeverall paſſages about all of them, The grand Committee of the Kirke ſat that day alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Feb. 16. The Scots Commiſſioners went on in their reports of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> negotiation. And a Committee was appointed to draw up Inſtructions for the Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> to receive, and report the addreſſes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners, which was the leſſe haſtened becauſe all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were not come to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> The Lord <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellor</hi> proteſted to the Committee of Eſtates that he had and would (to his uttermoſt) labour to make good

The Grand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Kirke appointed the next Lords day to be a publique Humiliation in all the Churches in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi> and parts adjacent, and appointed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to draw up a Declaration of the cauſes thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> Feb. 17. The Commiſſioners of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Scotland</hi> gave account to the Eſtates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the buſineſſe of the Kings going to the Iſland of <hi>Weight,</hi> as alſo the addreſſes to Him there, and ſome overtures between the Parliament and them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> Malignants here (for here are good ſtore of them in this City) were very mery that day; ſome of them were foxed before night, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny healths were drunke to King <hi>Charles</hi> (by them) but they did not meet (altogether) with their expectation, (Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Layton,</hi> and divers others that were Officers under the King, are here, but not very fluſh of money, and not many friends, their meetings are moſt among themſelves, and though fauned on by a few, yet laughed and jear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by moſt: They would faine ſtirre up the minds of the people to riſe againſt <hi>England</hi> for the King, but have no great influence. Here is like to bee a great conteſt (becauſe of many factions) and when the end will be God knowes.</p>
            <p>The Grand Committee of Eſtates were moved that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners might be ſent to, and (for that purpoſe) the Lord <hi>Chancellours</hi> Inſtructions brought in and paſſed, The Eſtates being advertiſed that there were foure of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners then come, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earle of <hi>Nottingam,</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſhurſt,</hi> Colonell <hi>Birch,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Goodwin,</hi> whereupon

            <p>
               <hi>Friday,</hi> Feb. 18. The Lord Chancellour <hi>Londone</hi> was diſpatched, and had his Inſtructions for going to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners to receive their addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the next day. The ſubſtance of Inſtructions were, To repaire to the Earle of <hi>Nottingam</hi> (and the reſt) the next day from the Eſtates and to receive ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes as they wer authorized unto from both Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to communicate to the Committee of Eſtates of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marquis of <hi>Arguile</hi> made an excellent ſpeech before the Eſtates moving to peace and amity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring how the Lord hath bleſſed the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, joyning in his cauſe, and moving that all may labour to ſtrengthen that unity between both Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Inſtructions were given from the Commiſſioners of the Kirke, to the members of the City of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and parts adjacent, concerning the publique humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to bee on the Lords day following, That the Lord ſhould be pleaſed to ſtay the Plague lately bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth in and about the City, that the Lord would direct the Eſtats and enable them to maintain the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: That the Lord would purge out all Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries out of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland:</hi> And that the Lord will ſettle them in peace, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Yeſter day the Committee of Eſtates choſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees who are to conſider of the Papers, according to Inſtructions, ſo that ther cannot be much expected from hence untill the Parliament ſit about March the ſixt next.</p>
            <p>Our Commiſſioners are not received in that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity by the Eſtates) as was expected.</p>
            <p>When the Parliament ſits here the great queſtion will be, whether they will condeſcend for an Army to paſſe into the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> are yet quiet and there is no appearance of any conſiderable viſible force acting or levying, only what the imaginations of the Cavaliers doth produce, who are ſomewhat high in the South part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſpeake broad words.</p>
            <p>The cheifeſt matters which have paſſed betweene the <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Eſtates</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are to this effect.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſsioners, communicated Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to the <hi>Scots,</hi> advertizing that they were ſent from the <hi>Parliament of England</hi> to cleare them of labours and indeavours for continuance of peace betweene the Nations, and to take off miſrepreſentations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring that they may be heard in ſuch things as ſhall be objected againſt their proceedings, that ſo there may be continued a right underſtanding between the Nations.</p>
            <p>They received a Paper backe from the <hi>Scots,</hi> of their order for the Chancellor to receive what they had to preſent.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners ſhewed their letters of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from the Houſes of Parliament to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Paper was ſent them backe that the Parliament was (ſince the date of the ſaid letters of credence) riſen,</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners then ſent in another Paper, concerning their Inſtructions from both houſes of Parliament to treate with the <hi>Committee</hi> of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which having paſſed both Houſes is of power equivalent as an Ordinance:</p>
            <p>This Anſwer is now under debate by the Grand <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Eſtates,</hi> where it was declared (by divers of the Members,) that it would be a breach both of the Covenant and Treaty to refuſe a Treaty with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners, ſeeing that they are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by authority of both Houſes.</p>
            <p>You in <hi>England</hi> may ſuppoſe delay, but need to feare no breach from hence, to ingage new warres. God ſend an happy peace, So prays,</p>
